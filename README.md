We make reasonable efforts to support our work. Submit a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/efernau/Docker-YetiForceCRM/issues) if you have a security or other general question about this Docker image.

### Running with Docker Compose

2. Run `docker-compose up -d` from the root of this project.
3. Access `http://{docker_host}:8000` from your web browser to finish setting up YetiforceCRM.
